# coromobility

This project is based on https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model repository version 3, 
with the following major differences:

1) We model the covid dynamic for 6 cities: New York, Paris, Madrid, London, Moscow, St Petersburg
2) We make use of apple mobility data as covariates instead of government interventions
